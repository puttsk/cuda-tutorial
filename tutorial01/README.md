# Tutorial 01: Say Hello to CUDA

## Introduction 

This tutorial is an introduction for writing your first CUDA C program and offload computation to a GPU. We will use CUDA runtime API throughout this tutorial. 

CUDA is a platform and programming model for CUDA-enabled GPUs. The platform exposes GPUs for general purpose computing. CUDA provides C/C++ language extension and APIs for programming and managing GPUs.

In CUDA programming, both CPUs and GPUs are used for computing. Typically, we refer to CPU and GPU system as *host* and *device*, respectively. CPUs and GPUs are separated platforms with their own memory space. Typically, we run serial workload on CPU and offload parallel computation to GPUs.  

## A quick comparison between CUDA and C

Following table compares a hello world program in C and CUDA side-by-side. 

<div markdown="1" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;">

**C**

``` C
void c_hello(){
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}

int main() {
    c_hello();
    return 0;
}
```

</div>

<div markdown="1">

**CUDA**

``` C
__global__ void cuda_hello(){
    printf("Hello World from GPU!\n");
}

int main() {
    cuda_hello<<<1,1>>>(); 
    return 0;
}
```

</div>

The major difference between C and CUDA implementation is `__global__` specifier and `<<<...>>>` syntax. The ```__global__``` specifier indicates a function that runs on device (GPU). Such function can be called through host code, e.g. the `main()` function in the example, and is also known as "*kernels*". 

When a kernel is called, its execution configuration is provided through `<<<...>>>` syntax, e.g. `cuda_hello<<<1,1>>>()`. In CUDA terminology, this is called "*kernel launch*". We will discuss about the parameter `(1,1)` later in this [tutorial 02](../tutorial02/). 

## Compiling CUDA programs

Compiling a CUDA program is similar to C program. NVIDIA provides a CUDA compiler called `nvcc` in the CUDA toolkit to compile CUDA code, typically stored in a file with extension `.cu`. For example

```bash
$> nvcc hello.cu -o hello
```

You might see following warning when compiling a CUDA program using above command

```
nvcc warning : The 'compute_20', 'sm_20', and 'sm_21' architectures are deprecated, and may be removed in a future release (Use -Wno-deprecated-gpu-targets to suppress warning).
```

This warning can be ignored as of now. 

## Putting things in actions. 

The CUDA hello world example does nothing, and even if the program is compiled, nothing will show up on screen. To get things into action, we will looks at vector addition. 

Following is an example of vector addition implemented in C ([`./vector_add.c`](./vector_add.c)). The example computes the addtion of two vectors stored in array `a` and `b` and put the result in array `out`.

```C
#define N 10000000

void vector_add(float *out, float *a, float *b, int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        out[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main(){
    float *a, *b, *out; 

    // Allocate memory
    a   = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);
    b   = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);
    out = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);

    // Initialize array
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        a[i] = 1.0f; b[i] = 2.0f;
    }

    // Main function
    vector_add(out, a, b, N);
}

```

## Exercise: Converting vector addition to CUDA

In the first exercise, we will convert `vector_add.c` to CUDA program `vector_add.cu` by using the hello world as example.

1. Copy `vector_add.c` to `vector_add.cu`

```bash
$> cp vector_add.c vector_add.cu
```

2. Convert `vector_add()` to GPU kernel

```C
__global__ void vector_add(float *out, float *a, float *b, int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        out[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}
```

3. Change `vector_add()` call in `main()` to kernel call

```C
vector_add<<<1,1>>>(out, a, b, N);
```

4. Compile and run the program
```bash
$> nvcc vector_add.c -o vector_add
$> ./vector_add
```

You will notice that the program does not work correctly. The reason is CPU and GPUs are separate entities. Both have their own memory space. CPU cannot directly access GPU memory, and vice versa. In CUDA terminology, CPU memory is called *host memory* and GPU memory is called *device memory*. Pointers to CPU and GPU memory are called *host pointer* and *device pointer*, respectively. 

For data to be accessible by GPU, it must be presented in the device memory. CUDA provides APIs for allocating device memory and data transfer between host and device memory. Following is the common workflow of CUDA programs. 

1. Allocate host memory and initialize host data
2. Allocate device memory
3. Transfer input data from host to device memory
4. Execute kernels
5. Transfer output from device memory to host

So far, we have done step 1 and 4. We will add step 2, 3, and 5 to our vector addition program and finish this exercise. 

### Device memory management

CUDA provides several functions for allocating device memory. The most common ones are `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`. The syntax for both functions are as follow

```C
cudaMalloc(void **devPtr, size_t count);
cudaFree(void *devPtr);
```

`cudaMalloc()` allocates memory of size `count` in the device memory and updates the device pointer `devPtr` to the allocated memory. `cudaFree()` deallocates a region of the device memory where the device pointer `devPtr` points to. They are comparable to `malloc()` and `free()` in C, respectively

### Memory transfer

Transfering data between host and device memory can be done through `cudaMemcpy` function, which is similar to `memcpy` in C. The syntax of `cudaMemcpy` is as follow

```C
cudaMemcpy(void *dst, void *src, size_t count, cudaMemcpyKind kind)
```

The function copy a memory of size `count` from `src` to `dst`. `kind` indicates the direction. For typical usage, the value of `kind` is either `cudaMemcpyHostToDevice` or `cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`. There are other possible values but we will not touch them in this tutorial. 

### Exercise (Con't): Completing vector addition

5. Allocate and deallocate device memory for array `a`, `b`, and `out`. 

6. Transfer `a`, `b`, and `out` between host and device memory. 
    * Quiz: Which array must be transferred before and after kernel execution ?

#### Example: Solution for array 'a'

```C
void main(){
    float *a, *b, *out;
    float *d_a;

    a = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);

    // Allocate device memory for a
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, sizeof(float) * N);
    
    // Transfer data from host to device memory
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, sizeof(float) * N, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    …
    vector_add<<<1,1>>>(out, d_a, b, N);
    …

    // Cleanup after kernel execution
    cudaFree(d_a);
    free(a);
}
```

7. Compile and measure performance. (See. solution in ([`./solutions/vector_add.cu`](./solutions/vector_add.cu)) )

```bash
$> nvcc vector_add.cu -o vector_add
$> time ./vector_add
```

## Profiling performance 

Using `time` does not give much information about the program performance. NVIDIA provides a commandline profiler tool called `nvprof`, which give a more insight information of CUDA program performance.  

To profile our vector addition, use following command

```bash
$> nvprof ./vector_add
```

Following is an example profiling result on Tesla M2050

```
==6326== Profiling application: ./vector_add
==6326== Profiling result:
Time(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name

```

## Wrap up

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to write a simple vector addition in CUDA. We introduced GPU kernels and its execution from host code. Moreover, we introduced the concept of separated memory space between CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to manage the device memory. 

However, we still not run program in parallel. The kernel execution configuration `<<<1,1>>>` indicates that the kernel is launched with only 1 thread. In the next [tutorial](../tutorial02/), we will modify vector addition to run in parallel.
